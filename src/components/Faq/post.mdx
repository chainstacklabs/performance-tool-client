## What is your stack?

We selected Python to leverage its concurrency capabilities, aiming to highlight how RPC nodes perform in fetching data efficiently while keeping a developer-friendly approach.

## Which chains/protocols/networks are supported?

Chainstack Compare is designed to test EVM-based RPC nodes. Currently, Chainstack Compare is compatible with Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon zkEVM, Arbitrum, Linea, Base, and opBNB.

## Which methods are used for measurements?

Chainstack Compare runs profiles based on standard Ethereum RPC methods that fetch blockchain data. Currently, it tests RPC endpoints using `eth_getBlockByNumber` and `eth_call`.
